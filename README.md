would like a pet to keep them company on hiking trips. They also think that their grandchildren would enjoy hanging out with the dog when
they visit. He found out about the website from a friend and he uses it mainly on his home computer.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<h3>Browser Compatibility (laptop)</h3>
<p>Using a Mac Book laptop I tested the site on three browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. All major functionality is currently consistent across all three browsers. I took the following steps to test functionality:
<ul>
  <li>Tested all links (navigation menus, buttons, inline): All links worked as expected and directed user to correct destination.</li>
  <li>Tested responsiveness: I adjusted the size of the window to see how site displayed at different widths. Site appears as expected across the three browsers, all media queries have the desired effect.</li>
  <li>Tested Javascript: Alerts triggered by clicks on dog photos and buttons function as expected across all three browsers.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Device Compatibility</h3>
<p>Using an iPhone 6+ I tested the site in the Safari for iOS browser. I took the following steps to test functionality:
<ul>
  <li>Tested all links (navigation menus, buttons, inline): All links worked as expected and directed user to correct destination.</li>
  <li>Tested responsiveness: I viewed the site in both portrait and landscape orientation. The site looks good and functions well in both orientations, but the cart icon and hero text at the top of all pages is currently overlapping in landscape mode and needs improvement.</li>
  <li>Tested Javascript: Alerts triggered by clicks on dog photos and buttons function as expected.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Improvements to be Made</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Hero image and text: There are some issues with positioning of the cart icon as the browser window width is adjusted. I will work to find a better solution for the positioning fir smaller window widths so that it looks uniform across all sizes.</li>
  <li>Blog Posts: As the window width is made smaller on desktop, or is viewed on a mobile phone, the images become very small. I will work on adjusting the size of the images so that they adjust to smaller, but still visible, size at smaller screen/window widths.</li>
</ul>
